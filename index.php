            <h1><u> Darke's Pack Deving: </u></h1> <h2>A (somewhat) Comprehensive Guide </h2>
            <p>
        This is intended to be a set of tools and notes used by myself and the people i work with when building Modpacks for Minecraft Java Edition. <br><br>
        Use the sidebar to access said tools and notes as catogorized by mod.<br><br>
        All code is done by myself at this point so expect bugs in some of the tools.
        Report them to my github repo for this website at <a href="https://www.github.com/DarkeFae/darkefae.github.io">My Github</a>
